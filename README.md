## üìñ About The Project

**4Blue** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Python that integrates 15 of the most essential utilities for information gathering into one convenient and interactive interface. It was created to accelerate the initial phases of penetration testing and security analysis by providing all necessary information "under the hood" and presenting it in a clean, readable format.

The core idea is to leverage the power of existing, time-tested tools (`Nmap`, `subfinder`, `ffuf`, etc.) by managing them through a single control center.The entire interface is fully localized in both English and Russian.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive TUI**: User-friendly and intuitive interface for tool selection.
* **Beautiful Output**: Scan results are formatted into tables and panels for easy readability.
* **Multilingual Support**: Available in English and Russian.
* **Simple Installation**: A single script to install all dependencies.
* **Integrated Help**: Descriptions for each tool are accessible directly within the program.
* **Export to HTML**: Don't lose your findings. After every scan, you can choose to export the full, colored output to an HTML file for your records.
